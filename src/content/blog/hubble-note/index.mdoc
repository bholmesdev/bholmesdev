So... I'm building a notes app. And it's called Hubble Note.

## What is it?

Hubble Note helps you remember everything you wrote down. It combines your notes, your chats, and your web browsing into a single tool, backed by a smart little assistant called Hubble. It's as simple as Apple Notes, but as powerful as Notion or Obsidian, without the learning curve.

## Why Hubble?

Apple Notes is awesome. You open it up, write something down, and close it when you’re done. It’s the default writing tool for pretty much everyone because of how dead simple it is.

And yet... you can’t find anything you wrote down. It’s a junk drawer where everything useful gets thrown and forgotten forever.

Except, unlike a junk drawer, some of your most important and valuable things get thrown in there. That Thai curry recipe your friend sent you a year ago that would be _perfect_ for the house party this weekend. That incredible YouTube lecture you pasted in your notes that would _really_ help for this job interview coming up. Those years of weeknight writing sessions you’d _love_ to catalog into one big list. But if you want to do any of these things, you’re handed tools straight out of 1995: a dumb search engine, and a chronological history. GLHF.

Why can’t there be an Apple Notes wizard to clean everything up for you? A wizard to come up with the right search term for anything you ask? A wizard to organize your thoughts into neat little folders? A wizard to condense a web of research rabbit holes into a clean abstract with backlinks?

I tried to be that wizard once. I followed the Zettelkasten method, and spent months perfecting Notion and Obsidian templates to find the perfect workflow. And after years of trying… I went right back to Apple Notes like the rest of you. Nothing beats a simple scratchpad you can open, write something down, and close when you’re done.

So why can’t we have something as simple as Apple Notes, but as powerful at organizing and expanding your thoughts as something like Notion or Obsidian? All without the learning curve and upkeep those tools demand?

That’s what Hubble Note is here to do. Hubble Note is a notes app that’s as simple to use as Apple Notes. But when it’s time to find, organize, or research ideas further, you can talk to Hubble to do what you need. Call it… Claude Code for your notes. Except without the code, and maybe without the Claude if GPT-5 proves smarter.

[this is where a slick prototype will go. It’s coming, I swear]

## Why me?

I have… an unhealthy obsession with writing things down. Both as a content creator and as a Markdown-loving engineer.

I think a timeline will help:

- **2018:** Started a technical blog to talk about web technologies ([hey dev.to](https://dev.to/bholmesdev))

- **2019:** Built a self-hosted blog using web technologies to talk about web technologies ([hey bholmes.dev](https://bholmes.dev))

- **2021:** Rebuilt that website without a framework, and accidentally invented my own. It was based on Vite and… yeah, Markdown ([hey Slinkity](https://slinkity.dev))

- **2022:** Got hired to work on a new framework people _actually_ used, and made it easier to build, organize, and extend your Markdown-based content ([hey Astro](https://astro.build))

- **2024:** Started working with LLMs, and realized they’re really good at writing. Like, better than me. And like me, they love Markdown too (hey GPT and Claude et al.)


**Present:** Decided it’s time to build a notes app that combines everything I’ve learned into one tool: a Markdown-backed writing app with a lovable agent that helps you build, organize, and extend your thoughts (hey Hubble)

## When can I try it?

Hubble is an experimental side project, so I won’t make any promises on release dates. But to watch the sausage get made, and hear when the sausage _gets_ made, follow my [Twitter](https://x.com/bholmesdev) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@bholmesdev) for updates, like this:
